This is a very simple MVR starting point for Node.js Express.  

Are you trying to incorporate the structure of MVC into your Node.js app?  
Or maybe you love Sinatra/Laravel styling routing and want that in your Node apps?
Either way this project is a great starting place to give you a flexible yet powerful 
structure to your Node.js apps.
